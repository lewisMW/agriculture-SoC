# NanoSoC Tech

## IP Requirements List
Top build a NanoSoC System, additional Arm Licensed IP is required. The IP that is requried is the following:
- Arm Cortex-M0 
- Arm Corstone-101 
- Arm DMA-230 (PL230) OR Arm DMA-350

If you are unable to license the Cortex-M0, you may be able to get access to the Arm Cortex-M0 designstart which contains an obfuscated version of the Cortex-M0 processor along with the CMSDK (which is also included in the Corstone-101 subsystem).

## Setting Up IP Library on your system
The filelists provided in project expect a specific file structure in order to be found.
Take a look at https://soclabs.org/design-flow/ip-library-structure to understand the recommended IP structure.
