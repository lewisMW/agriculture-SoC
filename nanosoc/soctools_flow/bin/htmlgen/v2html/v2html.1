.IX Title "V2HTML 1"
.TH V2HTML 1 "January 2009" "v2html 7.30.1.3" "v2html"
.SH "NAME"
v2html \- Verilog to HTML converter
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBv2html\fR [options] file1 [file2] ...
.PP
\&\fBv2html\fR is a perl 5 script that converts a bunch of verilog files to
html, linking various things to their definitions. At the moment
it handles:
.IP "\- modules" 5
.IX Item "- modules"
.PD 0
.IP "\- tasks" 5
.IX Item "- tasks"
.IP "\- functions" 5
.IX Item "- functions"
.IP "\- includes" 5
.IX Item "- includes"
.IP "\- defines" 5
.IX Item "- defines"
.IP "\- parameters" 5
.IX Item "- parameters"
.IP "\- inputs,outputs,inouts" 5
.IX Item "- inputs,outputs,inouts"
.IP "\- signals: wire, reg etc." 5
.IX Item "- signals: wire, reg etc."
.IP "\- mail addresses in comments" 5
.IX Item "- mail addresses in comments"
.IP "\- http \s-1URLS\s0 (http://....) in comments" 5
.IX Item "- http URLS (http://....) in comments"
.PD
.PP
It also generates a page containing all the modules it found arranged
hierarchically and separate index pages for all of the files, modules,
signals, tasks and functions.
.PP
Once you have the html files they can be installed on a web\-server, or
simply viewed using \*(L"Open File...\*(R" in your web browser.
.PP
Details on navigating around the converted files, and many examples
can be found at http://www.burbleland.com/v2html/v2html.html .
.PP
Note that as of version 5.0 \fBv2html\fR uses \fIcascading style sheets\fR
to colour the display. This means that pages viewed with old browsers
that do not support \fIcascading style sheets\fR (for instance Netscape
3) will not be coloured.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
In addition to the switches detailed below \fBv2html\fR also accepts and
ignores most VCS/VerilogXL options and all other options starting with a
plus. This means that you should be able to run it with the same
command file you use for running simulations.
.PP
Switches:
.IP "\fB\-q\fR" 5
.IX Item "-q"
Be quiet \- so don't print all those informative messages about what
it is doing.
.IP "\fB+define+NAME[=VALUE]\fR" 5
.IX Item "+define+NAME[=VALUE]"
Pre-define a value. This is just the same as putting:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \(aqdefine NAME [VALUE]
.Ve
.Sp
at the top of each of your input files. The rather strange syntax is the
same as VerilogXL's. This option is useful for controlling which ifdefs appear
true to \fBv2html\fR.
.IP "\fB+incdir+DIR\fR" 5
.IX Item "+incdir+DIR"
Specify a directory to search for include files (just like VerilogXL).
.IP "\fB\-y\fR\ \s-1DIR\s0" 5
.IX Item "-yDIR"
Specify a directory to search for modules (just like VerilogXL). Note that
\&\fBv2html\fR doesn't do any fancy search orders like VerilogXL \- it just searches
the directories in the order that you specify them on the command line.
.IP "\fB+libext+EXT\fR" 5
.IX Item "+libext+EXT"
Specify an extension use when searching for modules (just like
VerilogXL). You can specify multiple extensions using
\&\fB+libext+EXT1+EXT2+EXT2\fR or by specifying multiple \fB+libext+EXT\fR
options.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR\ \s-1LIBFILE\s0" 5
.IX Item "-vLIBFILE"
Specify a library file to use (just like VerilogXL).
.IP "\fB\-f\fR\ command_lines_options_file" 5
.IX Item "-fcommand_lines_options_file"
Specify a file to get more command line options from. For instance you
could put a list of all your files in src_files and then use \fB\-f\fR\ src_file.  You can also put in just about anything that you can put
on the command line.  Comments can be included using # or // at the
start of the line. Wildcards are not allowed in the file names. Use
single or double quotes to quote arguments that have spaces in them
for example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&          # v2html \-f file \- turn on gzip compression
\&          \-z \-ze .gz
\&          \-zc \(aqgzip  \-f\(aq
.Ve
.Sp
You can have as many \-f options as you want and you can probably put
\&\-f options in the file too.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR\ mail_addr" 5
.IX Item "-mmail_addr"
A mail address of the site maintainer. This is placed in a field at
the bottom of each file like this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& This page:
\&         Maintained by:         Joe_Bloggs@barking.com
\&         Created:               Thu Nov 6 08:53:37 1997
\&         From:                  test2.v
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-i\fR" 5
.IX Item "-i"
Incremental mode. At the moment this isn't very incremental! \fBv2html\fR
checks the dates on all of the files that it read last time it ran and
all of the output files it generated.  If any of the input files are
newer than the output files, or if the command line options have
changed it \fBdeletes\fR all of the files it made last time and rebuilds
everything. The delete is done to stop old files accumulating in the
output directory.
.Sp
\&\fBv2html\fR keeps track of all the information it needs to do this in
a file called .v2html_incr .
.IP "\fB\-o\fR\ output_dir" 5
.IX Item "-ooutput_dir"
Set the output directory for the html files. The default is the current
directory.
.IP "\fB\-css\fR\ cascading_style_sheet" 5
.IX Item "-csscascading_style_sheet"
The appearance of all the different elements of the html page can be altered
using a \fIcascading style sheet\fR. By default \fBv2html\fR uses a file called
\&\fIv2html.css\fR in the same directory as the html files. You can customize the
appearance of the html files by editing this file (\fBv2html\fR will create one
if it does not exist, but will not overwrite an existing one). 
.Sp
If you have many different html directories which you want to use the
one central cascading style sheet then you can use the \fB\-css\fR option
to specify one. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-css http://www.barking.com/joes_style.css
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-h\fR\ hier_file" 5
.IX Item "-hhier_file"
Set the name of the file that the hierarchy is written to. The default
is hierarchy.html. This is also used as a base for the index file
names.  These file names are formed put appending \f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-m\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-s\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-fn\*(C'\fR to the part of the hierarchy file name
before the first dot (so hier.htm will put the files index in
hier\-f.htm).
.IP "\fB\-ht\fR\ top_module" 5
.IX Item "-httop_module"
Set the name of a top module you want in the hierarchy. You can specify
multiple \fB\-ht\fR options to specify multiple top modules. 
.Sp
If you don't specify any \fB\-ht\fR options then \fBv2html\fR will inspect
the hierarchy and find all the top modules in the verilog files and
print these out. The 'top modules' are modules that are not
instantiated but instantiate other modules that \fBv2html\fR has found
the definition of.
.IP "\fB\-hc\fR\ hierarchy_comment" 5
.IX Item "-hchierarchy_comment"
Specifies some text to put at the top of the hierarchy. For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   v2html \-hc "This is our ASIC" *.v
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-htf\fR" 5
.IX Item "-htf"
Turns on printing of tasks and functions in the hierarchy. By default they
are not printed.
.IP "\fB\-lines\fR\ max_lines_per_file" 5
.IX Item "-linesmax_lines_per_file"
In order to speed up viewing \fBv2html\fR splits large verilog files across multiple
html pages. This option lets you specify how many lines you want on a page. The 
default is 1000.
.IP "\fB\-nnm\fR" 5
.IX Item "-nnm"
No \*(L"No modules\*(R". By default the hierarchy contains three sections, the
hierarchies of the top modules, a list of files containing no modules
and a list of unconnected modules (modules that are not instantiated
but also  do not qualify as top modules). The \fB\-nnm\fR makes
\&\fBv2html\fR skip printing the list of files containing no modules.
See \fB\-nu\fR.
.IP "\fB\-nu\fR" 5
.IX Item "-nu"
No unconnected. See \fB\-nnm\fR. Makes \fBv2html\fR skip writing the list
of unconnected modules in the hierarchy file.
.IP "\fB\-nh\fR" 5
.IX Item "-nh"
No hierarchy. Don't print out the hierarchy.
.IP "\fB\-nindex\fR" 5
.IX Item "-nindex"
No indexes. Don't print out the indexes.
.IP "\fB\-ni\fR" 5
.IX Item "-ni"
By default \fBv2html\fR 'greys out' any code that is ifdefed out. The \fB\-ni\fR
turns this greying out off. Note that v2html always ignores code that is
ifdefed out when it is parsing.
.IP "\fB\-z\fR" 5
.IX Item "-z"
Compress the html files generated (and make sure the links point to
the compressed versions). This can be useful if you convert machine
generated code, like \s-1ASIC\s0 \s-1RAM\s0 macros which are huge before they are
converted and even bigger afterwards.
.IP "\fB\-zc\fR\ compresser" 5
.IX Item "-zccompresser"
The executable to use to compress the html files if \fB\-z\fR is used. The
Default is 'compress \f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR'. For instance to use gzip use \fB\-zc\fR 'gzip \f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR'
(the \f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR stops gzip prompting you about overwriting files).
.IP "\fB\-ze\fR\ compressed_extension" 5
.IX Item "-zecompressed_extension"
The extension that your compress executable uses. The default is '.Z'. If you
were using gzip then you'd want \fB\-ze\fR .gz
.IP "\fB\-F\fR\ [frame_file.html]" 5
.IX Item "-F[frame_file.html]"
Frame mode. Using \fB\-F\fR turns on the generation of framed output
where a top level frame file is generated that creates three
frames in your browser, the top one for the hierarchy the middle
one for the code and the bottom one for any definitions to appear 
in.
.Sp
The default name for the frame file is frame.html. This default
can be overridden by specifying a file name after the \fB\-F\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-VF\fR\ [frame_file.html]" 5
.IX Item "-VF[frame_file.html]"
Same as \fB\-F\fR but arranges the frames vertically so that the hierarchy is
down the side.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 5
.IX Item "-s"
Link to the source. This causes the file name in From field of
the page footer to become a link to the unconverted verilog 
file:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& This page:
\&         Maintained by:         Joe_Bloggs@barking.com
\&         Created:               Thu Nov 6 08:53:37 1997
\&         From:                  /asic/verilog/test2.v
.Ve
.Sp
For this to work your web server must have access to the source code.
Also, you must either run v2html in the output directory or use
absolute path names for the verilog files.
.Sp
For example, if the source is in /home/asic/verilog and the html files
want to end up in /home/www/verilog then there are two ways to run it
to get \fB\-s\fR to work:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  1) In the output directory with verilog files specified by relative paths:
\&        cd /home/www/verilog
\&        v2html \-s ../../asic/verilog/*.v
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& 2) In any directory with verilog files specified by absolute paths:
\&        cd /anywhere
\&        v2html \-s \-o /home/www/verilog   /home/asic/verilog/*.v
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-c\fR\ /cgi_script\ /path_to_html_files" 5
.IX Item "-c/cgi_script/path_to_html_files"
Activate \s-1CGI\s0 features which allow the user to hide and show
regions of the hierarchy in a similar way to the old file manager
on windows 3.1. This method only works if you put the files on
a web server.
.Sp
To use this you must have installed the v2html \s-1CGI\s0 script on your
web\-server. The /cgi_script is the name of the \s-1CGI\s0 script (with path).
The /path_to_v_files is the directory you are putting your html files.
.Sp
These paths are the paths your web server sees (not the full paths on
the system) so is the same path that appears after \fIhttp://server\fR when 
accessing the files.
.Sp
Here's an example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  cp v2html\-cgi /opt/CERNhttpd/cgi\-bin/ 
\&  chmod 755 /opt/CERNhttpd/cgi\-bin/v2html\-cgi
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  cd /home/web/v2html/example/ex1
\&  v2html \-c /cgi\-bin/v2html\-cgi /v2html/example/ex1 ../verilog/*.v
.Ve
.Sp
Note that \fBv2html\fR can't check the parameters to \fB\-c\fR while
converting the files. You'll have to do it yourself by viewing the
hierarchy in your web browser and clicking on \fB[Hide\ All]\fR at the
top of the hierarchy. Make sure you view the file using the web server
(use \fIhttp://server/v2html/example/ex1/hierarchy.html\fR rather than
\&\fIfile:/home/web/v2html/example/ex1/hierarchy.html\fR).
.Sp
Depending on your webserver you may also need to use the \-css to
specify the full \s-1URL\s0 to your cascading stylesheet eg:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& v2html \-c /cgi\-bin/v2html\-cgi /v2html/examples/millennium_clock/hier_cgi
\&  \-css http://www.burbleland.com/v2html/examples/millennium_clock/hier_cgi/v2html.css
\&  *.v
.Ve
.Sp
If you get a message like this when you click on \fB[Hide\ All]\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  Bad script request \-\- neither \(aq/opt/CERNhttpd/cgi\-bin/v2html\-cg\(aq 
\&        nor \(aq/opt/CERNhttpd/cgi\-bin/v2html\-cg.pp\(aq is executable
.Ve
.Sp
Then either there is either a problem with the installation of the cgi
script or you have incorrectly specified the first parameter to \fB\-c\fR.
.Sp
If you get a message like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  v2html error.
.Ve
.Sp
then you have probably got the second parameter to \fB\-c\fR wrong.
.IP "\fB\-k\fR\ key_string" 5
.IX Item "-kkey_string"
Specify the key to use for to stop people looking at hierarchy files
that are protected by web-server security. The default is to use a
random key, but this means that you can't have bookmarks of the
hierarchy in various states (because the bookmark will contain the
key, and the key will change each time you run \fBv2html\fR). To get
round this problem you can use \fB\-k\fR and always have the same
key string. The key can be any string of digits and letters.
.IP "\fB\-njshier\fR" 5
.IX Item "-njshier"
Deactivate Javascript features that allow the user to hide and
collapse regions of the hierarchy.
.IP "\fB\-ncookies\fR" 5
.IX Item "-ncookies"
The Javascript version of the hierarchy uses cookies to remember the state
you left the hierarchy in, so when you next visit the hierarchy page it will
be in the same state. If you hate cookies then use the \fB\-ncookies\fR option
to turn them off.
.IP "\fB\-nsigpopup\fR" 5
.IX Item "-nsigpopup"
Turn off the generation of javascript that does the signal popup window.
Specifying this option also turns off \*(L"Quick Search\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-tab\fR\ value" 5
.IX Item "-tabvalue"
Expand tabs to the specified value.
.IP "\fB\-debug\fR" 5
.IX Item "-debug"
Turn on lots of debugging information.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.IX Header "AUTHOR"
Costas Calamvokis <\fIv2html730@burbleland.com\fR>.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
Here is an example where \fBv2html\fR is run in the directory containing
the verilog files (note the \fB\-o\fR option):
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  cd /users/jb/verilog_files/
\&  v2html \-F my_frame.html \-h my_hier.html \-ht chip_top \-htf \-nu
\&    \-o /users/www/project/verilog \-m Joe_Blogs@barking.com \-s *.v
.Ve
.PP
As the verilog files don't have absolute paths and we aren't running
in the destination directory can't use \fB\-s\fR (link to source) as the
links \fBv2html\fR will create wouldn't allow the web server to find the
files.
.PP
Here is an example where \fBv2html\fR is run in the directory where
we want the html files (no \fB\-o\fR option):
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  cd  /users/www/project/verilog
\&  v2html \-F my_frame.html \-h my_hier.html \-ht chip_top \-nu \-htf
\&    \-m Joe_Blogs@barking.com \-s  
\&    \-c /cgi\-bin/v2html\-cgi /project/verilog ../../../jb/verilog_files/*.v
.Ve
.PP
Here we can use the \fB\-s\fR option because we are running the the destination
directory, so the links \fBv2html\fR creates to the source will work
(providing the web server is allowed to server files from
/users/jb/verilog_files).
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
By default \fBv2html\fR tells you a lot about what it is doing (this is
because it is slow and if it didn't you'd think it had crashed!). These
messages can get in the way of the warnings \fBv2html\fR produces, so if
you have a problem first try \fB\-q\fR (quiet) to see if there are any warnings
you missed in the deluge of messages.
.PP
Most of the Error messages concern failures to open files, I guess these
will be caused by bad permissions, or you pointing \fBv2html\fR at files
or directories that don't exist.
.PP
The errors that say things like:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   Warning: Confused in t.v line 2 (state=SIGNAL_AFTER_NAME):
\&   wire g  xx;
\&           ^
\&mean that you have written some verilog that I wasn\(aqt expecting \- send
\&it to me and I\(aqll see what I can do.
.Ve
.PP
Most of the warnings concern things that \fBv2html\fR will ignore because
it found more than one of them. The most common is a duplicate module
being found because an old copy of one of the files is lurking in
your source directory. The easiest way around this is to use the
\&\fB\-f\fR option something like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  ls /path/*.v | grep \-v old_module_file.v > src_files
\&  v2html \-f src_files
.Ve
.PP
Generally \fBv2html\fR will ignore duplicate things (so for example
modules won't appear in the hierarchy), but sometimes it will just pick
one of them, so watch those warnings.
