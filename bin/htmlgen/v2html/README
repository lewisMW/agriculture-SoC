Unix Installation
-----------------

- Copy v2html to somewhere like /usr/local/bin.
- If you are using the CGI script then see your web-server's documentation
  on where to put CGI scripts.
- Copy v2html.1 to somewhere like /usr/local/man.

If your copy of perl is not in /usr/bin then you will have to edit the
first line of v2html and v2html-cgi to refer to where your copy of
perl in installed. Alternatively you could install a link from 
/usr/bin/perl to your copy of perl.

Windows Installation
--------------------

- Put the v2html script somewhere (eg C:\v2html)
- Then, assuming you have Perl installed as c:\perl\bin\perl.exe, you should
 be able to run v2html from a DOS box with a command like this:

  c:\perl\bin\perl.exe c:\v2html\v2html -f my_cmd_file.vc
